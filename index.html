    <h2>About the Book</h2>
    <p>
      Piwee is a child-sized supermarket trolley who dreams of growing up to be like the adult trolleys. The wise General teaches him the importance of listening and staying safe. But when The General is taken away and lost like so many other supermarket trolleys, Piwee sets out on a brave (and risky) rescue mission. Along the way, he gathers other abandoned trolleys and shows great courage â€” but learns that teamwork, planning, and adult advice are key.
    </p>

    <h2>Message for Supermarkets & Schools</h2>
    <p>
      Piweeâ€™s story promotes environmental responsibility and highlights the issue of lost or stolen trolleys that affect communities everywhere. This book supports awareness campaigns, sustainability efforts, and reading programs for children ages 5â€“9.
